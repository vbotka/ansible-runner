Below is a simple playbook that calls this role (10) at a single host
srv.example.com (2)

.. code-block:: yaml
   :emphasize-lines: 2,10
   :linenos:

   shell> cat ansible-runner.yml
   - hosts: srv.example.com
     gather_facts: true
     connection: ssh
     remote_user: admin
     become: true
     become_user: root
     become_method: sudo
     roles:
       - vbotka.ansible_runner

.. note:: ``gather_facts: true`` (3) must be set to gather facts
   needed to evaluate OS-specific options of the role. For example, to
   install packages the variable ``ansible_os_family`` is needed to
   select the appropriate Ansible module.
